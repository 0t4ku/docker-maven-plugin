This plugin supports als configuration via a  https://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose] file, especially for running containers specified in `docker-compose.yml`. Docker Compose handling is available also as an external configuration provider.

.Example
[source,xml]

     <basedir>src/main/docker</prefix> <!--4-->
     <composeFile>docker-compose.yml</composeFile>
  </external>
</image>

<2> Plugin specific `<run>` configuration for all services.
<3> The type for the external configuration provider must be set to **compose**
<4> Additional configuration where to find the compose file
