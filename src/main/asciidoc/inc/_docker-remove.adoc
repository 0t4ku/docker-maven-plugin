[[docker:remove]]
== **docker:remove**

This goal can be used to clean up images and containers. By default
all so called _data images_ are removed with its containers. A data
image is an image without a run configuration. This can be tuned by
providing the properties `removeAll` which indicates to remove all
images managed by this build. As with the other goals, the
configuration `image` can be used to tune the images to remove. All
containers belonging to the images are removed as well.

Considering three images 'db','tomcat' and 'data' where 'data' is the
only data images this example demonstrates the effect of this goal:

* `mvn docker:remove` will remove 'data'
* `mvn -Ddocker.removeAll docker:remove` will remove all three images
* `mvn -Ddocker.image=data,tomcat docker:remove` will remove 'data'
* `mvn -Ddocker.image=data,tomcat -Ddocker.removeAll docker:remove`
will remove 'data' and 'tomcat'
