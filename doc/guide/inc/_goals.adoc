= Maven Goals

This plugin supports the following goals which are explained in detail
in the following sections.

|===
|Goal |Description

|link:docker-build[`docker:build`]
|Build images

|link:docker-start[`docker:start`]
|Create and start containers

|link:docker-stop[`docker:stop`]
|Stop and destroy containers

|link:docker-push[`docker:push`]
|Push images to a registry

|link:docker-remove[`docker:remove`]
|Remove images from local docker host

|link:docker-logs[`docker:logs`]
|Show container logs

|link:docker-source.md[`docker:source`]
|Attach docker build archive to Maven project
|===

Note that all goals are orthogonal to each other. For example in order
to start a container for your application you typically have to build
its image before. `docker:start` does *not* imply building the image
so you should use it then in combination with `docker:build`.
