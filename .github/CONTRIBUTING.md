You want to contribute ? Awesome ! We LOVE contributions ;-)

Here some things to check out when doing a PR:

* Please sign-off your commits as described in [Contributing](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin/blob/master/doc/contributing.md).
* If adding a new feature please [update the documentation](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin/blob/master/src/main/asciidoc/), too.
* Don't forget the unit tests.
* If adding a new configuration option, don't forget to add this to the [PropertyHandler](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/io/fabric8/maven/docker/config/handler/property/PropertyConfigHandler.java), too.

However, if you can't do some of the points above, please still consider contributing. Simply ask us on `#fabric8` at Freenode or via an GitHub [issue](https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin/issues). We are not dogmatic.
